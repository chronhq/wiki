# Onboarding

Welcome to Chron! Here is an overview of where you can find information you want, and - if interested - how you can help Chron.

Current release can be found on www.chronmaps.com

## The Wiki - our knowledge base

If you're reading this page, you're probably reading it from our Wiki, https://chronhq.github.io/wiki/. This is where you should start.

We put in our Wiki summaries of discussions we had, features we are implementing or planning to implement, tutorials etc. It's a very high-level overview of what Chron is and is not.

## Discord - our chat

If you haven't done so yet, please join us on our public Discord: https://discord.gg/srnDdKd. Our daily conversations are happening there. In particular, read through the `#info` channel first to know about the different channels we have. Our Dev team is using mostly Slack, so feel free to ask for invite in Discord if interested.

If you have any questions that are not answered in the wiki, Discord is the best place to ask them. 

## Github - our code and project management

Github is mostly used to host code, and that's what we do, because all code at Chron is open-source. Have a look at these two code repositories if you are interested in the code:

- https://github.com/chronhq/backend
- https://github.com/chronhq/frontend

If you found any issues concerning data inaccuracy we have a special repo for that:

- https://github.com/chronhq/data

However, we also use Github for general project management. Here are the most interesting parts:

- Project Kanban board: https://github.com/orgs/chronhq/projects
- Issues concerning hosting, branding, communications, team organization are currently discussed in Slack and random issues in frontend repo, however we plan on moving all team organisation plans someplace in wIki also. 
- This Wiki is actually also a repository on its own! You can modify its content here: https://github.com/chronhq/wiki
