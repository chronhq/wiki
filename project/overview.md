#Project overview

Chrono is developed for history enthusiasts by other history enthusiasts and universities to create and maintain a comprehensive history database. The system of “layers” allows users to create their own narratives based on the interconnections of certain facts.
The first step is to acquire an amount of data that is big enough to engage community and universities to participate.
The aim of this MVP is to demonstrate our main idea and basic implementation of certain features to accumulate community and financial sources for future development.
