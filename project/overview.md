# Project overview

Chron was founded by international team of developers and history enthusiasts to create a tool that helps create and maintain a comprehensive history database.  

A courageous idea to combine all political maps with timeline continues to attract more people to the project, creating a community of researchers and enthusiasts that are willing to contribute and promote history knowledge to general public in fun and interactive manner.  

Apart from general public the project targets wide range of researchers offering them a tool to extend their research, find interconnecting data and events and eliminate “blind spots” in world history with the help of recognized sources.   

The key feature is an online platform which offers a draggable map, and the possibility to travel in time on this map. Apart from that the system of “layers” allows users to create their own narratives based on the interconnections of certain events and environment.
