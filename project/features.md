  * Interactive Map
  
  Countries differ by color (13 main colors for min zoom level and 7 additional colors for max zoom level). Disputed territories are marked with colors of countries that claims ownership, striped. Borders have list of sources that can be displayed by clicking on the territory. Existing maps can be navigated by timepanel.
  * Facts
  
  Political entities, actors and events are presented on the map as facts; they are all interactive. All facts are backed by sources links that can be checked and voted upon. As for the first version all facts are taken from crowdsourced database [Wikidata](www.wikidata.org).
  * Narratives
  
  Narratives are chronological series of facts representing the author’s subjective view with attached hypermedia (video, text, image). Authors can create different narratives based on facts database and maps modifications. We are eager to bring some interactivity to longreads.
  * Voting
  
  Facts  that’s sources are backed by trusted authorities are considered more reliable. Voting is also implemented into the narratives. 
  * Search
  
  * Admin Interface

  To be decided upon later.
