# Project overview

This project is developed for history enthusiasts by other history enthusiasts and (hopefully) universities to create and maintain a comprehensive history database. The system of “layers” allows users to create their own narratives based on the interconnections of certain facts. The key feature is an interactive map that demonstrates how political borders changed through years.
