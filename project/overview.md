# Project overview

This project is developed for history enthusiasts by other history enthusiasts and (hopefully) universities to create and maintain a comprehensive history database. The key feature is an online platform which offers a draggable map, and the possibility to travel in time on this map. Apart from that the system of “layers” allows users to create their own narratives based on the interconnections of certain events and environment.
